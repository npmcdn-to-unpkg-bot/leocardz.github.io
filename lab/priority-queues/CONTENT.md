A priority queue is an abstract data type which is like a regular queue or stack data structure where each element has a priority attached. In it, the FIFO (first-in-first-out) rule is not necessarily followed. An element with a higher priority is taken before an element with lower priority. If two elements have the same priority, they are taken according to their order in the queue.

An element can be inserted into a priority queue at any time, but only the element with highest priority can be retrieved for operations. The Priority Queue concept can be implemented in many different ways in different data structures. The structures with the best efficiency of priority queues are the heaps. Here we are gonna show some of them...

Below there are links to all implementations of several applications of Priority Queue concept.

* Heaps
  * Priority Queue
    * [Binary Heap][0]
    * [Avl Indexed Binary Heap][1]
  * [Min-Max Heap][2]
  * [Radix Heap][3]
* Usage
  * [Heap Sort][4]
  * [K-Numbers (Smallest/Largest k numbers of the priority queue)][5]
