Library with the aim to analyze the pixel colors of an ARGB image.

The picture above will generate a palette below.

### How to use that? 

Simple user the jar file.


    
    
        java -jar pca.jar [filename] [amount]
    
    

You also can suppress amount. This way, the full palette will be generated.
Obs.: For images that have many colors it can take a while to generate the window with the colors.


    
    
        java -jar pca.jar [filename]
