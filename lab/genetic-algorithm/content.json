{"title":"Genetic Algorithm","content":"A genetic algorithm (GA) is a very interesting and useful technique to find solutions for complex problems. These algorithms have that name because they are based in the behaviour of the genes, natural selection, mutation and crossover. They're commonly used to design computer algorithms to solve other optimization problems. Genetic algorithms work by mimicking the way life finds solutions to real world problems using the process of evolution. Although genetic algorithms are capable of solving incredibly complicated problems, they are way simple to understand. Candidate - Set a candidate solutiona, the optimum value. Initialization - Create an initial population with random individuals and each one with its own genetic code. Evaluation - Each member of the population is then evaluated and we calculate a 'fitness' for that individual. The fitness is calculated by how many similarities that the current individual, in analysis, have compared to the Candidate. Selection - For constantly improving the population's overall fitness, the best individuals must be selected for crossover and, then, create a new population closer to the Candidate. Crossover - During crossover we create new individuals by creating crosses of our selected individuals, the parents. The combination of these parents will create an even 'fitter' offspring for the next population which inherits the best genes of both individuals. Mutation - After the crossover, the mutation replaces some genes in the new individual. Otherwise, every combination in crossover will be the initial population, then the fitness would remain the same every evolution. And repeat it until find the optimum solution!
