{"title":"AVL Tree","content":"An AVL tree is balanced binary search tree. Its name contains the letters of its inventors, Adelson-Velskii and Landis, it was the first dynamically balanced tree to be proposed. The AVL trees may not be perfectly balanced, but pairs of sub-trees differ in height by at most 1, keeping an O (log N) search time. Addition and deletion operations also take O (log N) time. The following propositions define an AVL Tree: The subtrees of every node differ in height by at most one. Every subtree is an AVL tree. Search : Searching for a specific element in an AVL Tree can be done the same way as that of a normal unbalanced Binary Search Tree, that is: The searching starts by examining the root node. If the tree is null, the key we are searching for does not exist in the tree. Otherwise, if the key equals that of the root, the search is successful and we return the node. If the key is less than that of the root, we search the left subtree. Similarly, if the key is greater than that of the root, we search the right subtree. This process is repeated until the key is found or the remaining subtree is null. If the searched key is not found before a null subtree is reached, then the item must not be present in the tree. It can be a recursive or an iterative process. Insertion process is like the search; if the key is not equal to that of the root, we search the left or right subtrees as before. Eventually, we will reach an external node and add the new key-value pair as its right or left child, depending on the node's key. In other words, we examine the root and recursively insert the new node to the left subtree if its key is less than that of the root, or the right subtree if its key is greater than or equal to the root. After inserting a node, it is necessary to check each of the node's ancestors for consistency with the rules of Avl. And it is measured by the Balance Factor. The balance factor is calculated as follows: balanceFactor = height (left subtree) - height (right subtree). As the tree is balanced at every insertion (if necessary), the height of an AVL subtree cannot increase by more than one, so the temporary balance factor of a node will be in the range from âˆ’2 to +2. f the balance factor becomes less than âˆ’1 or greater than +1, the subtree rooted at this node is unbalanced, and rotations are necessary to make the tree balanced again. Rotations are operations that change the structure without interfering with the order of the elements. A tree rotation moves one node up in the tree and one node down. It is used to change the shape of the tree. The AVL Tree has 4 types of rotations: Right rotation : consists in rearranging clockwisely the positions of two nodes. Left rotation : consists in rearranging anticlockwisely the positions of two nodes. Right-Left rotation (AKA Double Right) : consists in rearranging clockwisely (first rotation) and anticlockwisely (second rotation) the positions of three nodes. Left-Right rotation (AKA Double Left) : consists in rearranging anticlockwisely (first rotation) and clockwisely (second rotation) the positions of three nodes. Sometimes a single rotation is not sufficient to balance an unbalanced tree, that's why the double rotations are needed. The first and second rotations are not performed on the same node. Source: Wikipedia Deletion : Like Insertion, the Deletion is similar to the Search. For deleted leaf nodes, clearly the heights of the children of the node do not change. Also, the heights of the children of a deleted node with one child do not change either. Hence, if a deletion causes a violation of the AVL Tree height property, this will occur on some node on the path from the parent of the deleted node to the root node. To restructure the tree after a deletion we will call the restructure method on the parent of the deleted node.
