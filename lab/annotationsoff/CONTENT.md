You must find those text bubbles on Youtube videos boring just like me. So, this lightweight Chrome Extension was developed to remove all unwanted annotations and cards in Youtube videos making them clean and more pleasant to see. Enjoy it!

The latest release you will always find it available on Chrome Web Store [AnnotationsOff][0].

Those are examples how it looks like with and without annotations and cards:
