Using [Font Awesome][0] in any project allows you to make it beautiful and save your time that you would spend creating icons. What if it could be on Android?! How _awesome_ would it be?! Fortunately, it is totally possible!



You already know how to use custom fonts learned [HERE: Custom Font without Memory Leak][1], then you need only to make few changes as follows:




* 
Add fontawesome.ttf on assets folder;

* 
Create FontAwesome class that makes reference to the file on assets folder;

* 
Create FontAwesomeTextView that uses FontAwesome as typeface;

* 
Create a set of strings referencing each Font Awesome icon;




This would be the result!
