Paraphrasing [Felix Krause's setup repo][0], here is some information about the setup I'm currently using.

* I use [iTerm2][1] instead of the stock terminal Mac app
* I use [oh-my-zshell][2]
* I use [Solarized Dark][3] for the terminal colors
* I use [powerline-shell][4] to get those cool path bars.
* I use [powerlevel9k][5] theme to easily customise the shell. [This is my currently customisation][6]
* I use the [Meslo Powerline Font][7] as you need a font that supports the directory characters for powerline
* I use [z][8] an amazing tool to quickly jump between projects. It learns which directories you visit most and autocomplete their path on the terminal
* I use a set of aliases for git and you can check them at [GitAliases][9]
* I use [TermHere][10] to open a terminal on a specific folder from Finder. I just changed the Terminal App option on its configuration to open iTerm2 instead stock Mac terminal.
