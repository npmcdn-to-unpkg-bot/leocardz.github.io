{"title":"What terminal is Leo using","content":"Paraphrasing Felix Krause's setup repo , here is some information about the setup I'm currently using. I use iTerm2 instead of the stock terminal Mac app I use oh-my-zshell I use Solarized Dark for the terminal colors I use powerline-shell to get those cool path bars. I use powerlevel9k theme to easily customise the shell. This is my currently customisation I use the Meslo Powerline Font as you need a font that supports the directory characters for powerline I use z an amazing tool to quickly jump between projects. It learns which directories you visit most and autocomplete their path on the terminal I use a set of aliases for git and you can check them at GitAliases I use TermHere to open a terminal on a specific folder from Finder. I just changed the Terminal App option on its configuration to open iTerm2 instead stock Mac terminal.","path":"what-terminal-is-leo-using","image":"http://i.imgur.com/zrFGeVY.png","released":true,"date":"2016-06-09T11:04:54.000Z","github":"https://github.com/LeonardoCardoso/What-terminal-is-Leo-using","tags":["terminal","iterm2","zsh","oh-my-zsh"]}
