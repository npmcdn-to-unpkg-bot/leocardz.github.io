If you search the web the definition of algorithm, the more frequent answer is "An algorithm is a finite sequence of instructions defined and unambiguous, each of which can be performed in a finite period of time and a finite amount of effort. ". This is just a basic idea. If perhaps you've never heard that word, know that for sure you practiced it at some point in your life.


Have you ever cooked?! If yes, you followed the recipe steps to have the desired food, or at least it was meant to be. The fact is that if the sequence of steps is not followed as it is written in recipe, the end result can not be as the expected one. What if you have to hang out... Do you put on your shoes before the socks and then wear the pants? Such steps aren't really good, it's not a good idea. And this algorithm can be performed in three different ways that will produce the same outcome, can you perceive that? But these examples are simple, for there are much more complex algorithms, and others algorithms exist only in theory. Huh?! How so?! Just keep reading... 


Perhaps **Algorithm** is the most used term in the of Computing area. But it doesn't represent a specific computer program. It may have its implementation and execution on a computer, a mechanical machine, another automata, and until, of course, by people like the examples shown above. Different algorithms can accomplish the same task using a different set of instructions which may result in more or less expenditure of time, space or effort. And these attributes are related to the computational complexity that was applied to the algorithm and that depends directly on the data structure that was built into it. It is obvious that if you put your socks and shoes and then wear the pants that will take longer and be more work than you wear the pants first. Two different algorithms, but they will produce the same result. 


There are several ways to represent an algorithm more formally, some of them are a flowchart, coding and automata. Even more specific types of algorithm, such as neural, natural, sort, search, encryption, meta-heuristics, quantum, and many others. In the future, they will have their own post here. 


On what was talked about only theoretical algorithms, was an example that can be given is the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), that is an optimization problem of finding the route of least effort in which the Salesman visit exactly once all the cities and then return to your original city, but precisely it's about to find the lowest cost across all nodes of a weighted graph. The computational effort required to solve this problem grows exponentially in scale in relation to the given input (number of cities). In Analysis of Algorithms, it belongs to a class called NP-hard or NP-complex. Thus, since it is difficult, or even impossible, to determine optimal solution of this class of problems, methods of resolution that go through the heuristics that, in the mathematical point of view, do not ensure obtaining an optimal solution, but try to approximate the much as possible the optimal resolution. 


This was a brief idea about what is algorithm but remember, the algorithm is not ~ algarithm ~ (there is no such word, but people insist to say that), even less algarism...
