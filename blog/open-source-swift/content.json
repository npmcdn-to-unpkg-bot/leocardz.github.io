{"title":"Apple's Swift now is open source! Ok, now what?!","content":"Apple got everyone surprised at this year's WWDC when they disclosed that Swift would be open source. They did it yesterday! They released Swift on GitHub under Apache 2.0 License . Ok, but you must be asking what do I have to do with it?! If you are a final client, perhaps you won't notice such difference of an app built in Swift or another programming language. But if you are a developer and not familiar with this language, you will find it kinda fascinating and more intuitive than other languages. Swift makes things simpler. And that can affect the final user, apps being built faster with a better performance. On my personal experience, from the scratch of an app to its publishing on Apple Store took about 14 days, including Store's revision process. You can check it out here . For me, this is the natural order of scaling a product and make it more reliable to the developers and customers: Open Source. The advantages of an open source product is the flexibility that allows developers that are not inside the box to solve the issues, because they can show better solutions and the community stands together, thousands of new people inside that code, with more confidence over the language. But can it spoil the code? Well, that's why the standards of contributing exist for those kinda of stuff. Tests must be run to check that changes won't bring back past issues. There's is a control. This is a huge step for Apple, the first step ~I'm sure~, sometimes criticized for being closed in its own product world. Soon, we'll be seeing Swift softwares on Windows, Linux, Android(?), etc. Hopefully you are as anxious as I do.","path":"open-source-swift","image":"http://i.imgur.com/U7TuUhm.png","released":true,"date":"2015-12-04T15:42:16.000Z","tags":["apple","swift","open source"]}
