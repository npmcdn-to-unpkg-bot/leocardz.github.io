Everybody that uses Internet daily is using thanks to the developers and designers around the world. If it wasn't by their work, we'd be stuck in the past. If you are one of the people who think that programming is a kind of magic or another world's stuff, for others it seems more something seamlessly natural, passionate, intuitive, and even pleasant. But how?!

Have you ever noticed how much kids love stories?! From the movies or books... When they ask you to read for them?! That's right! If you think about a movie and its components, you will find out the screenplay, the director, the actors, the production, the scenarios, etc... All those components you may also find in programming! For example, the screenplay is detailed idea to be developed, the director may be the product owner, the actors are the developers, the production is the resources you have to program and the tracking of the whole process of programming, the scenarios are the small parts of the big idea. 

Wait, wait, wait! In fact, these terms are about a complete software process and really technical for children, they can assimilate this naturally though, just like they learn a new language that's totally different from that which they speak, learn how to ride a bicycle, learning how to swim. Nobody starts programming knowing building all those stuff. We don't learn to ride a bicycle without training wheels first. We do start easily. In programming, we start with **Algorithm**.

_An algorithm is a finite sequence of instructions defined and unambiguous, each of which can be performed in a finite period of time and a finite amount of effort._

> An algorithm is a finite sequence of instructions defined and unambiguous, each of which can be performed in a finite period of time and a finite amount of effort.

In other words, an algorithm is some steps you do before something. Think about the bike. You mount the bike, prepare the pedal and push it down, so the bike starts moving. The steps you did are in favor of the goal, which is moving the bike. Not always the goal is reached by only one algorithm though. Thinking about swimming, if your goal is to cross the pool, you can use different styles to do it, some faster, some less tiring... Can you think about other way to cause the bike to move besides the example I gave? 

The algorithm is the main component of programming along with **Mathematical Logic**. With them, you will be able to learn any existing programming language. Some adjusts may be necessary from programming language to language, just like the spoken languages. But the core, the communication, is the same.

Ok, but why should the children learn how to program?!

Well, the kids have the ability to learn faster and more than the others, and coding is as beneficial as music lessons. The evolving process of their brains expand. They will be able to solve problems more naturally and faster, break complex problems into smaller ones, divide and conquer. They will know how to use abstraction, think outside the box. Additionally, they got in contact with mathematics more often. The triple combination is the basis of Computer Science: Mathematics, Logic and Algorithm. That's our main tools to solve problems. The kids will learn the **Computation Thinking**.

> Computational thinking is the thought processes involved in formulating problems and their solutions so that the solutions are represented in a form that can be effectively carried out by an information-processing agent.

I was born in '90\. I grew up seeing the technology a thousand faster than my parents did, and I'm sure that our future kids will see computers billions of times faster than we do. It's the science fiction coming true. The children of the mid of '2000 already were born in world totally connected, they don't even know what is rewinding a VHS video tape. 

But you can't force a child to program, you need to incentive him/her. If he/she likes a game, you can ask if he/she would want to know how a game is made, how a robot moves, and so on... The very own interest and curiosity about technology is even better to welcome them to the Matrix. The idea that the children can use their own imagination to build what they want is ideal to boost interest on them. To show them that they can use tech to make something useful to a lot of people.

> Once you know how to code, you can create virtual worlds within the computer where the only limit on what is possible is your imagination.
> [Why every child should learn to code][1]

And if we can do what we can do now, just imagine what we would be doing if all of those programmers around the world started in their childhood. We'd be some years ahead from our current time technologically speaking.

Additionally, you don't need to introduce a programming language to a child in the first place. There are several projects that introduce the concepts nicely to the children, such [LEGO Mindstormsâ€Š][2]

> Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer... Because it teaches you how to think.
