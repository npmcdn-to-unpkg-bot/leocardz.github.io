We live in an era of mass surveillance. And things don't seem to change in an early future. Information is valuable and they pay (mi|bi)llions for that. But in a privacy-free world, only moulded and conditioned people would live.

Our behaviour changes dramatically when we know that we are being watched. How many times have you seen "Smile, you're being watched!" inside lifts or places with a CCTV system?! The range of free thought and action about the options we have around reduces because we think how those people who are watching are analysing us. For us, developers, we don't like being watched when they are programming. Creativity leaks down.

In Brazil, we have this expression that most parents or adult relatives say to their kids: "Olha que Papai do céu está te vendo!". It can be roughly translated to "Watch out because God (heavenly Father) is looking at you". But it kinda sounds more like a threat for the kid to behave. It reminds Google's slogan "Don't be evil". It's absolutely wrong to think that only a person evolved to bad activities wants some privacy. They usually says that "because if you are not doing anything wrong, you don't need to worry about.". Is that so?! No reason to fear that huge companies and the Government are monitoring you and your family, all the time?! For them, only those who confront power might be worried of privacy, which is not true.

In fact, our information becomes valuable for companies that live mostly with ads. Their machines learn about our lifestyle by our information and they can target specific ads for us. Apple claims that it's not use our data for ads, since their business doesn't depend on advertising. Unlike Google and Facebook that have targeted advertising as their largest incoming source. The more they know about us, the more they earn.

No one wants a Big Brother of George Orwell's 1984 around! Everyone wants a little privacy.

This video is an great speech given by the journalist Glenn Greenwald who helped Edward Snowden's disclosures of classified files. His work on the NSA files was in part the subject of the film Citizenfour, which won the 2014 Academy Award for Best Documentary.

This next video is how our data should be stored at the companies' servers.
