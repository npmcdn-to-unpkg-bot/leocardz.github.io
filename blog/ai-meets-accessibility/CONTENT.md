Facebook's AI team has been doing a significant improvements on their researches.

Inspired in biology, the AI network is basically a network of simulated neurons. 

They _teach_ this virtual mind showing some pictures and telling it what it is. For instance, some pictures of dogs and stating the breed, the AI starts to learn the characteristics of that breed and then it can recognize the dog breed in another picture with the dog in a different position. 

Their artificial intelligence is about to help people. Now their advances enable their AI to read the images for you. Read?! Yes! The algorithm 'looks' at a picture and say what it _may_ contain. The biggest bottlenecks here are the reliability and the speed on recognizing the photo elements. It's just the start...

Regarding accessibility, the reading of images can provided vision-impaired people to picture the picture in their minds. A girl in the video says that only three words help to flash out the details she can't see. What about a whole statement?! It opens a huge door... An extension... An amplification of what we can do!

They are moving towards their goal: Build intelligent machines to help people in their daily lives.
